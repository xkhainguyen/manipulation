Points can be directly mapped to corresponding model points to specify the position and orientation of an object in the scene. In most cases, we have far more points than we have decision variables on the object's pose. Therefore, treating each point correspondence as an equality constraint would make the problem over-constrained. This raises a natural question:\n\na. What is the minimum number of points that can uniquely specify the pose of an object in 2D? Provide a brief mathematical justification.\n\n> 2D object can be represented by 2 numbers for position and 1 number for orientation. So there are 3 variables, we need 3 equality constraints => 2 points (each gives two)\n\n2. What is the minimum number of points that can uniquely specify the pose of an object in 3D? Provide a brief mathematical justification. \n\n> 3D object can be represented by 3 numbers for position and 3 number for orientation. So there are 6 variables, we need 6 equality constraints => 3 points\n\n### Exercise 4.4 (Point Registration with Fixed Rotation)\n\na. Position of the object: x, y\n\nb. If this is an LS then no constraints, if linear systems then linear constraints\n\nc. Evaluate objective function $(p_O - [3; 10])^2 + (p_O + [2; 0] - [5; 10])^2 + (p_O + [-2; -5] - [1; 5])^2$ \n\nd. It is a quadratic bowl. We have a simple analytical solution to this.\n\n### Exercise 4.5 (Planar Two-Point ICP)\n\nTODO(khai)\n\n### Exercise 4.8 (Outliers in ICP)\n\nIn this question you'll explore a technique for handling outliers in ICP and think through how the distance metric impacts the robustness of ICP to outliers. There are two parts to this question and each part has three subquestions.\n\na. \n\n1. > c1 = 1, c2 = 2, c3 = 2, c4 = 3, c5 = 3, c6 = 4. ICP error = 13.8\n2. > (b2, r3) and (b3, r5) have the largest distances then scene points r3 and r5 are most likely outliers\n3. > New ICP error = 5.7\n\nb. The optimization in ICP captures the distance between two sets of points as the sum of pairwise Euclidean distances. As a thought experiment: another possible distance metric (which isn't as optimization friendly) is the one-way Hausdorff distance. Stated simply, given that an adversary picks a point on one shape, the one-way Hausdorff distance is the distance you are forced to travel to get to the closest point on the other shape. We could consider two schemes:\nScheme 1) The adversary picks the scene point and thus you pick the model point that is closest to this scene point.\nScheme 2) The adversary picks the model point and thus you pick the scene point that is closest to this model point.\n\n1. > (r5, b4) = 4\n2. > (b1, r1) = 1.4\n3. > Scheme 2 is more robust because the adversary picks the model point (which is always valid) and thus I pick the closest scene point (which is not likely an outlier)\n\n### Exercise 4.10 (Composing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs))\n\nTODO(Khai)","block_group":"999d72dc1532414aa4cd8c9f8af3341d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=c9ab9462-2e93-497a-abba-3cabc40dd5dc' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"28dd7ea179db4685aab7d91b0205480c","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
